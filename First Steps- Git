First guide on git. The very manual, learned to created repositories, pull, merge and edit changes.
I can call it the very basic training of git, the barebones. More than 10 minutes to say. 
I took my time and ended up in a half an hours, worth, course. Thats me i guess.
Also the first Article. Well.
