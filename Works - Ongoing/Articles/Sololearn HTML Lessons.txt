Modern Web Design

HTML: Structure
CSS: Presentation
JavaScript: Behavior

PHP or similar: Backend
CMS: Content Management
Other elements can be used either as block level elements or inline elements. This includes the following elements:
APPLET - embedded Java applet
IFRAME - Inline frame
INS - inserted text
MAP - image map
OBJECT - embedded object
SCRIPT - script within an HTML document

You can insert inline elements inside block elements. For example, you can have multiple <span> elements inside a <div> element.

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<!DOCTYPE HTML> 
seven main content models.

- Metadata
- Embedded
- Interactive
- Heading
- Phrasing
- Flow
- Sectioning
Metadata: Content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest of the content. These elements are found in the head of the document.
Elements: <base>, <link>, <meta>, <noscript>, <script>, <style>, <title>

Embedded: Content that imports other resources into the document.
Elements: <audio>, <video>, <canvas>, <iframe>, <img>, <math>, <object>, <svg>

Interactive: Content specifically intended for user interaction.
Elements: <a>, <audio>, <video>, <button>, <details>, <embed>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <label>, <object>, <select>, <textarea>

Heading: Defines a section header.
Elements: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <hgroup>

Phrasing: This model has a number of inline level elements in common with HTML4.
Elements: <img>, <span>, <strong>, <label>, <br />, <small>, <sub>, and more.
Flow content: Contains the majority of HTML5 elements that would be included in the normal flow of the document.

Sectioning content: Defines the scope of headings, content, navigation, and footers.
Elements: <article>, <aside>, <nav>, <section>

In HTML5, a simple <header> tag is used, instead.

Article is a self-contained, independent piece of content <article>
<section> is a logical container of the page or article.
<aside> is secondary or tangential content which could be considered separate from but indirectly related to the main content.

audio   attribs, control autoplay loop
video tag the same

With HTML5 web storage, websites can store data on a user's local computer.
Before HTML5, we had to use JavaScript cookies to achieve this functionality.

The Advantages of Web Storage
- More secure
- Faster
- Stores a larger amount of data
- Stored data is not sent with every server request
Some APi Wich we will do later
img src svg width heigh
- cx pushes the center of the circle further to the right of the screen
- cy pushes the center of the circle further down from the top of the screen
- r defines the radius
- fill determines the color of our circle
- stroke adds an outline to the circle

rect
line (x1, y1) define the start coordinates(x2, y2) define the end coordinates.
<polyline> defines shapes built from multiple line definitions:
<svg width="2000" height="500">
    <polyline style="stroke-linejoin:miter; stroke:black; 
        stroke-width:12; fill: none;"
        points="100 100, 150 150, 200 100" />

animate
attributeName: Specifies which attribute will be affected by the animation
from: Specifies the starting value of the attribute
to: Specifies the ending value of the attribute
dur: Specifies how long the animation runs (duration)
fill: Specifies whether or not the attribute's value should return to its initial value when the animation is finished (Values: "remove" resets the value; "freeze" keeps the “to value”)
repeatCount: Specifies the repeat count of the animation

In the example above, the rectangle changes its x attribute from 0 to 300 in 3 seconds.
capitals absolute position
lower case relative position
canvas width height needs script
Draw a Line
moveTo(x,y): Defines the starting point of the line.
lineTo(x,y): Defines the ending point of the line.

Draw a Circle
beginPath(): Starts the drawing.
arc(x,y,r,start,stop): Sets the parameters of the circle.
stroke(): Ends the drawing.

Gradients
createLinearGradient(x,y,x1,y1): Creates a linear gradient.
createRadialGradient(x,y,r,x1,y1,r1): Creates a radial/circular gradient.

Drawing Text on the Canvas
Font: Defines the font properties for the text.
fillText(text,x,y): Draws "filled" text on the canvas.
strokeText(text,x,y): Draws text on the canvas (no fill).
Canvas vs. SVG


Canvas
- Elements are drawn programmatically
- Drawing is done with pixels
- Animations are not built in
- High performance for pixels-based drawing operations
- Resolution dependent
- No support for event handlers
- You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
- Well suited for graphic-intensive games

SVG
- Elements are part of the page's DOM (Document object model)
- Drawing is done with vectors
- Effects, such as animations are built in
- Based on standard XML syntax, which provides better accessibility
- Resolution independent
- Support for event handlers
- Not suited for game applications
- Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (for example, Google Maps)
HTML5 has introduced a new attribute called placeholder. On <input> and <textarea> elements, this attribute provides a hint to the user of what information can be entered into the field.
required

HTML5 added several new input types:
- color
- date
- datetime
- datetime-local
- email
- month
- number
- range
- search
- tel
- time
- url
- week

New input attributes in HTML5:
- autofocus
- form
- formaction
- formenctype
- formmethod
- formnovalidate
- formtarget
- height and width
- list
- min and max
- multiple
- pattern (regexp)
- placeholder
- required
- step
