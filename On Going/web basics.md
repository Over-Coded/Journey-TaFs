Welcome back, it is time to dust off some basic computer skills. So to be precise here, in the next set of courses, we will be getting up to snuff in Computer fundamentals, basic and intermediate skills. We will also get a bit more into depth with some web technologies, and some introductory videos for Web Development, namely front and back end technologies.

21a) - [Computer Skills Fundamentals](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Computer_Skills/Fundamentals)
Using the keyboard and the mouse, the absolute minimums on feeding the computer info. Well it is nice to get back to the core every once in a while, really makes you understand how much you have improved. 
Mouse needs no explanation just view the video and read some of the articles provided. If you need you can advance into more advanced techniques, like a trackball or a digitizer, both are a very pleasant experience.
Typing, well typing now is another subject on it's own. Here is the very basics like using the keyboard. Don't bother to much with it, just go to the website typing.com and do the lessons. I am using it regularly and it is the primary reason all my fingers are typing, instead of using only two or three.
Simple and no more than 10 minutes, moving on to basics.

21b) - [Computer Skills Basics](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Computer_Skills/Basic)
Don't fret over the number of subjects cause, first of all it is really small and easily covered. And second, do you see the intermediate section? yes? good cause, it is bigger. Now that we have established that, let us begin with "Internet".
"Internet" Just as the video title, Internet 101. After browsing through the page, you'll eventually end up in the activities section. They are about half an hour's worth, if you take your time in it. Navigation of the internet from within the browser and how to search the internet. Hyperlinks and of course bookmarks. These are the foundations of internet usage and concepts.
"Email" Sticking to the web skills, this is also a familiar term to a lot of us. Digital equivalent of the original hand written mail, with an "e" up front meaning "electronic" mail. Down to the activities section and like the "internet" course about half an hour. Explanation about the email providers, three of them, you can find many email providers, just be careful. Creating an account and some interface guide. After this article, you will have an email and know how to communicate with people. Also there is a section about etiquette writing and composing a message. Moving on...
"Hardware" My department, the touchable components of your computer. Input devices are what is used to deliver the info to your machine and output is whatever is delivering you information. After that we have, in desktop computers, the case. Inside are all of the components witch process all that info and the magic happens. CPU, Graphics card, Power supply, hard disks and many more. Learning the distinction of Desktops, Notebooks and Tablets, as well as their usage is also very nice to know. It is also nice to be Familiar with were you can find the serial number and manufacturer stickers on the components.
And moving on to "Software Concepts" the untouchable parts of your computer, the digital parts. Smaller even, some terminology about files and applications, and a general feel and look of using your digital environment.
"Word Processing" Basic word processing, meaning creating and editing a file inside your computer containing words, a simple text or word document if you may. And a new introduction about the clipboard, it is more or less a space that saves everything you copy and allows you to paste it somewhere else, also used for the Move-Paste commands. Lastly about spell checking and printing your work.
And now the stylistic section "Formatting", styling your text is the less techie term. Not much to say, just do the activities, and we can move on to the rest of this "short" section.
"Presentations" More or less a PowerPoint tutorial. It is a software that we use to combine, images, moving images and text, in order to create from presentations to lessons and showcase them. 
"Graphics" Include nothing fancy ether. The activities are constricted around the bundled with Microsoft software called Paint. For a true assignment, use paint, word, and PowerPoint to create a presentation. Name it Computer Skills 101 and play with it. You can use it to recap all knowledge from this section, use internet and email as well.
"Multimedia" Yeap, videos and music, the usual suspects. How to recognize them, and add or manipulate them. Why don't  you add some of them inside the presentation you made, completing the activities as well as learning.
Closing up we have the "Spreadsheets" otherwise known and as Excel or Microsoft Excel, part of the office suite as well. All in all after you get familiar with the cells, enter some data and play with, a revelation will hit you with the endless possibilities of excel. It is wonderful and powerful, but we have plans for it later, now the basics. The last step is to conduct a search inside, after you have place some data and we are done. It is time to hit the Intermediate section and wrap this up. In Wikiversity the sections of advanced and proficient are not completed, we will complete them with some lessons on our just for the sake of completion.
