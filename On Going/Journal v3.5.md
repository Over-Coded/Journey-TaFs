Welcome again to more changes and more personal hiccup's. For starters please take a look inside the folder structure. We have 4 main folders now, we need to keep the work flow to a sane level, so let's explore. Improvements is the first and it is all about contribution. Simple? Just make a file with your feedback or changes inside and push it. After that I will make all needed edits and place your name inside the Contributor's list. Simple. Also note that I will try to contact you before I make any changes, so there is that. Onwards to the Legacy folder, very self explanatory but for the sake of reference and all that. All of the older files are now in one place. Moving on the WiP Folder, witch stands for Work in process. Holding up all the projects I am working on right now, articles in the works, todo list, templates, etc. And lastly, this is from my beloved significant other, the RiO Folder, Standing for reviews in Order. Cause inside the BlogSpot page, after viewing my last lesson about blog structure and post, I made some changes. And to clarify I have added tags to the reviews, posting them as separate posts. Effectively creating a sorting system and separate uploads to social media. Meaning better advertisement and social strategy. C/V will hold now all links and references to lessons, and first steps will be as of now a journal recording, holding changes in free write.
That's about it.
