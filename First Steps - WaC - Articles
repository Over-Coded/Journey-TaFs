*Dec 23. <-- Due to the free time we are reading all lessons again, and rewriting all 
articles.

1) - https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/  #1 Starter

First guide on git. The very manual, learned to created repositories, pull, merge and edit changes.
I can call it the very basic training of git, the barebones. More than 10 minutes needles to say. 
I took my time and ended up in half an hour's worth of course. That's me i guess. Also to note that 
the guide is based on website control, no command line support. Also the first Article. Well.

2) - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide

Second guide, a google result, it turned out to be practical as advertised. But the order is a bit
weird, i went from configurating the git to searching terms i had no clue what they were. Well all
in all it is rich and content friendly. It is not for me at this point, so i will keep it around as
a reference and for random questions. Well as of now, i have visited this guide many times, i have 
added that it helped me a great many times. Not only the guide itself, but also the comments, you can
find a great deal of resources, answering to some more inquisitive minds.

3) - https://guide.freecodecamp.org/git   #2 Starter 2nd

Now this is what i call entry level, the most useful guide so far. I can feel entry level now, we 
got some basic concepts and 101s. Git is a distributed control system that helps multiple users or
coders have access to a file or program (hosted online on repositories) and modify it. Plain? Simple?
Yes but not so much. What really shines is in the inner workings, and in this git-case, the impeccable
history, and logging, containing date, time changes and comments. Imagine 100 people proof reading the 
same page on the excact same time, on different places. After they are done they send the pages to the 
author to review and accept or refuse the changes. This is git, takes all pages, compares the changes, 
checks the reasons for the changes, merges the changes with the orignal page, and voila 1 page merged 
with 100+ corrections. Ending in a clandestine document passed by 100 set of eyes, and also a history
behind it, all the changes that it went through from the orignal state, along with the reasons for the edit, 
the date/hour and the author of the changes. All that in real time, connecting literally all of the world.
Clone - Modify - Stage - commit - push. Five words, is all i have.

4) - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol   #3 Basic after some VScode Tut.

This was one more step up, inside the basics always. We dwelved inside the VSCode, the text editor
of choice, more on that later, there are over 6 lessons to be covered here. Some basic integration
is not bad to know. So all in all our editor of choice has all the functions already, just some 
configurations. New introduction was the extensions inside the editor, more as we go there. For the time
being, "Github Pull requests" the extension, it allows you to proccess and accept pull requests from within 
our IDE.
Also now we see, in the status bar below the text editor, the username we have inside GitHub. another
new tool to have around is the Azure DevOps. Another online host of personal repositories, which connects
perfectly with your github account, and your Microsoft account. VsCode + Github + Azure Devops. before
the question "why another one like GitHub?", personally i think it will have its uses. We will keep it 
around and see in time. Could be a Gem in the long run, or a powerful portable solution, time will tell.
I wish i had some training in VScode, waiting for another chair, my house and my multi-monitor setup.

5) - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/   #4 Basics Done.

Well, useful but i could not follow it via the correct order. Around half of the guide the instructions
tells you to add a sample.html. All cool, but the surprise came when you actually have to create it first,
inside the local repo directory. Yeah, welcome to the frustration, the newbie got stymied. After a good 
day searching the most creative key words ever, i asked in the QaA cumminity. Namely Stack Overflow, a 
specialized central to ask anything programming-wise. There are communities about every subject inside Stack 
Exchange, the mother site of QaAs. Wanna ask something about something? Go there, first choice.
So after a question, some edits, some more searching, i was tinkering inside bash and an error came up.
Searching about it, came to answer my own question and sove all my problems with git and that bash.
Ending my frustration and the tutorial. Coding is all about experimenting, asking, problem solving,
and using communities. So i have a feeling that today we did all of that. Mission accomplished and some 
extra, "https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions". This little gem, provided us with
the umpf we needed, and also supplemented this course lovely. Pulling a repo, accepting an issue and
solving it, pushing and getting a pull request, waiting for acceptance of edits, and thus making the
first active contribution ever. I would say at this point that we have completed the basics, with git, and
that we now need more specialized knowledge, more on skillset.

6) - https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-
positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/

Well a rather funky tutorial, has taste of humour that might not apeal to everyone. I dont know if there
is a bare minimum in anything, and i dont know what the heck encodings is. But joel says he can rectify
that, and trust me he does. It had some techines iniside i cant say, but skiping past the terms and a bit
math, i got it. How from ASCII we went to the Oem and later to Unicode. Speaking of witch unicode was the 
attempt to unify all codes. All letters in unicode are assigned to an id, named code point. Eventually all
words are a set of code points. Now on to encoding, first the Byte Order Mark, witch adds an EF or FF to the
code point, telling you if its up in the memory or low. Also UTF-8 with 1 byte storage on 8 bytes. UTF-7, 
UCS-4 and plenty. After reaching the end of Joel's guide, we know what encoding is, how to use it and how 
to effectively debug encoding errors. Also a reference to the Unicode map. Id dare say that Bare Minimums
are achieved.

8) - https://www.w3.org/International/getting-started/characters
9) - https://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/

W3.org, quality site, the tutorials are well written, the ones i used anyway... Needless to say, one link
led to another, and maybe there are four tutorials. Anyway, those got a bit techie, but all in all, they 
cover fonts, repertoirs, sets, application in CSS and HTML, escapes, ASCII, BOM Byte Order Mark. Nice more on
encodings later.

10)- Creative Writing by Margaret Atwood.

Now that was a course i enjoyed not alone. Around 4 hours. Covers the aspects of how to write, the
perspectives of the story, not so basic, i will review it again and try to understand it a bit better.

11) - What you need before you start Programming.

Not much, mostly a motivational video, i watched it with the seek bar on the move. Anyway key points, 
learned how to create a system of learning, how to tell between what i need to learn and what i want 
to learn. Well it helped at least. I thought it was about the tools and the environment you need before the 
actual thing.

12) - https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github

Well a tutorial on git, and not only, many languages. Finished the first day, learned about collaborating
issue fixing and taking over, sorry my mind stopped. on todo.
