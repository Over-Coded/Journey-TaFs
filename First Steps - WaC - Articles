*Dec 20. <-- Articles will be renamed into WaC "Writing Along the Curriculum"

1) - https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

First guide on git. The very manual, learned to created repositories, pull, merge and edit changes.
I can call it the very basic training of git, the barebones. More than 10 minutes to say. 
I took my time and ended up in a half an hours, worth, course. Thats me i guess.
Also the first Article. Well.

2) - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide

Began reading it from a google result, it turned out to be as advertised, practical.
It's rich, and beginner friendly. I read about half of it, it contains alot of info,
on many aspects of git, i am keeping it arround as a reference bookmark. usefull.

3) - https://guide.freecodecamp.org/git

Most usefull so far, i read through it, got an idea of the configutration, basic commands, 
learned some more advnaced commands, and will help me with anki this one.

4) - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol

How i learned to configure git and use it from within  my computer and to edit files with VsCode.

5) - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/

Well, usefull but cant follow it via order. Arround half of the guide, it tells you to add an sample.html 
via commands, you also need to create it in the local area, were you cloned the repository.
At this point i got stuck, began reading other material, even asked in stackoverflow, 
eventually, the solution was found and i was able to continiou reading this guide.
Good one... but...none the less, good one.

6) - https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-
positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/

I dont know if there is a bare minimum in anything, and i dont know what the heck encodings is.
That changed after the article. Well it is abit tech savy, with all the byte theory behind it.
But it makes sense, i understood what encoding is, how, when and where is used, got some references
for encodings, highly usefull to have arround. The most important i found out, was the the know how
to fix a page that has encoding problems, common problems, the reason behind it (Yeap you guessed it bytes)
and how to specify encodings in the page. In code, thats right.
Bare minimums Achieved.

7) - https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding
8) - https://www.w3.org/International/getting-started/characters
9) - https://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/

W3.org, quality site, the tutorials well written all those i have used so far. Needles to say, one link
lead to another, and maybe there are four tutorials. Anyway, those got a bit techie, but all in all, they 
cover fonts, repertois, sets, appliance in CSS and HTML, escapes, ASCII, BOM Byte Order Mark. Nice more on
encodings later.

10)- Creative Writing by Margaret Atwood.

Now that was a course i enjoyed not alone. Arround 4 hours. Covers the aspects of how to write, the
perspectives of the story, not so basic, i will review it again and try to understnad it a bit better.

11) - What you need before you start Programming.

Not much, mostly a motivational video, i watcched it with the seek bar on the move. Anyway key points, 
learned how to create a system of learning, how to seperate skills from what i need to learn and i want 
to learn. Well helped at least. I though it was about the tools and the enviroment you need before the 
actual thing.

12) - https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github

Well a tutorial on git, and not only, many languages. Finished the first day, learned about collaborating
issue fixing and takin over, sorry my mind stoped. on todo.
