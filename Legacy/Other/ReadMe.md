# Journey to Full Stack

This is an education log, documenting all that is gained while learning web development, and in particular, lessons, articles, courses, tutorials will be reviewed. Eventually I will upload my list of all the lessons I have about the subject. We are talking about 800GBs of video tutorials, books, audio books, and email correspondence relating to news and articles for web development from 2016.

After some "life" events, I needed to change jobs, and do something more remote, for a living. Conversations were the result of it, and self learning Web Development, was the solution. My significant other, being a brilliant mathematician, took over the planning department while I was creating an extensive Curriculum or Syllabus

## Acknowledgments

* My beloved one, Andrianni, whom without her endless support and motivation, all of this would be just an idea. Perhaps not even that.

Welcome my name is Alexander and I am from Greece. This sounds like the English lessons we had in school, well it does the job, let us continue. I am a computer technician or repairman, as you might say it in the common slang. I specialize in computer hardware, home and small shops, repairs and common tasks. Right now I am on a "journey" as you might say it hence and the name of the project, to become a self taught, freelance, full-stack developer. Some of my terminology is a bit off, so please correct me if I got something wrong. The projects concept is to log this Journey in a Online Git log, repository, maintaining a structure of a Website sitemap of sorts, containing skills and everything acquired and whole process. Succefully creating an Portfolio and a C/V. Another idea was to write reviews, about all the learning material used, effectively using the write to learn technique, both for understanding and in an effort to develop my writing skills. The reviews will feed the blog, in an effort to acquire some money through adds, views or by freelancing as a amateur writer, to upgrade my equipment. Ultimately I am hopping to provide income while providing for my family.
