Welcome to my education log, this will be the staging zone for the end project.
This will contain, 2 files at first, one with the running changes, etc. and another,
containing the articles for the courses and resource material used through the log.

The legacy folder will contain the old logs, also a version and date log.
Improvements are meant for anyone willing to contribute to this project.
About me section will contain a Curriculum Vitae of sorts, holding current skill level in
all the departments, along with concepts, techniques, and tools.
