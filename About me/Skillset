First off we need to create a global scale system, one that will help us count.
Counting on a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 100. This is a personal tryout to 
a self assesment and improvment.

1-20    <-- Basic
20-40   <--Advanced
40-60   <--Intermediate
60-80   <--Expert
80-100  <--Master

Now depending on language or software or whatever is beign evaluated, reasons 
for numbering will be explained on the skill. Until i think of something better.
