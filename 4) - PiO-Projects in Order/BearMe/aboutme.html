    <p>Hey, my name is Alexander, and there's little I find more exciting than bears! Or so the original story goes, not here. This is my time for a personal remark. This was a step up project from the original. First links and now linking inside the webpages, that also means creating the link to-go as well. From one cage creation to two, next one will have some CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, only cause it is needed for reference. Let us go further into this land of Page creation.
