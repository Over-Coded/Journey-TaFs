# Journey to Full Stack

This is an education log, documenting all that is gained while learning web development, and in particular, lessons, articles, courses, tutorials will be reviewed. Eventually I will upload my list of all the lessons I have about the subject. We are talking about 800 gb of video tutorials, books, audio books, and email correspondence relating to news and articles for web development from 2016.

## Let us begin. 

Cloning and editing in your own machine is all that is required. Just push your changes and I will update the content along with credits.

# Education Log
Eventually, this will become a great website. Able to help anyone, 
by reading it and seeing a tutorial written by someone as they go.
I cannot afford to buy education for web developing, so we will go 
through self-learning. But this is very difficult, and I am also
entirely new to this, everything is going to be from scratch.

I will log everything, process, tutorials, resources, cause this is
going to be a long long journey, and we will need some impeccable 
documentation.
Happy New Year.
