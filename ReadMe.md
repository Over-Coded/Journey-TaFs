# Education Log
Eventually, this will become a great website. Able to help anyone, 
by reading it and seeing a tutorial written by someone as they go.
I cannot afford to buy education for web developing, so we will go 
through self-learning. But this is very difficult, and I am also
entirely new to this, everything is going to be from scratch.

I will log everything, process, tutorials, resources, cause this is
going to be a long long journey, and we will need some impeccable 
documentation.
Happy New Year.
