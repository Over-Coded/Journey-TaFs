# Knowledge-Tracker
Eventually, this will become a great website. Able to help anyone, 
by reading it and seeing a tutorial written by someone as they go.
I cannot afford to buy education for web developing, so we will go 
by self learning. But this is very difficult, and i am also entirely
new to this, everything is going to be from scratch.

I will log everything, proccess, tutorials, resources, cause this is
going to be a long long journey, and we will need some impecable 
documentation.
