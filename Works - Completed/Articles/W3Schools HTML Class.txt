1. HTML W3 Schools

2. I am utterly amazed.

3. This is propably the most expansive lesson i have had in HTML so far. The tutorial is deep, building your knowledge of the subject, brick by bvrick. With try it out editors, on every step of the way. After that you got exercises, to test your education on the matter. And last but not least the big quiz, to help solidify eveything. Hands down the best tutorials so far. I am stymied.
