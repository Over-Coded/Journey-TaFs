1. Basic HTML & HTML5


2. Well it was a starter, a really good starter.


3. FreeCodeCamp - First Lesson.

4. That was my first lesson on the matter. I know FCC may seem daunting at first, but it really isn't.


5. Flow
The Flow of lessons was marvelous. Taking on the basic tags of HTML and slowly building on them, tag after tag. While at the same time, you are building something.

6. Projects
At the end of the lesson, I had created the following:
1 - One Basic tag reference site.
2 - CatphotoApp Page. 
3 - An about me page.

7. I took this class as a starter on HTML. It was a really good one. I created a couple of webpages, starters, but all in all it was a really goood one. Good flow and even better explainations. Took me about 4 days to get it done twice.

I learned the basic tags of HTML and HTML5 Semantic Tags.
