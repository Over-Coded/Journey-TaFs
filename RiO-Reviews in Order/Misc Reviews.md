Blogging, Blog post Writing, viral.

Welcome! According to today's schedule, it is a blog day. And this course was the best option for a beginner's class. So without further ado, let us proceed to the overview.

It begins with a very basic and short part about how your blog should be structured precisely. Moving on from general blog strategy to post writing strategy. Covering everything from the headline picking to grammar checking tools. There is even a part that covers the angles on post writing. Simple, detailed and not very long as well, about 73 minutes.

And as I mentioned before this lesson is around 1 hour and 13 minutes. Not very long considering the output of info it has. Very detailed and he also has a very clear voice which makes the lesson so much better. On to the actual thing now. After the introduction video, there are some basic blog structure rules. The category of your blog, subcategory's and topics. Closing in with a few tips on how to pick an angle, for writing your post. Followed by a template, and to be honest that was a very good idea, and explanation's for each part. First up is the headline name picking and some suggestions, cause the actual headline strategies are explained more detailed in the ending videos. The new pickup was: SEO - Search Engine Optimization, which is used by search engines to find keywords and makes your post more easily discoverable. Again, more about that in later courses. Onwards to the introduction of the post, an anecdote or a short story. Or a Nutgraph, meaning a Post in a nutshell paragraph. To a transition line that makes getting into the main body of the post more smooth. This is followed by a few supporting key points to solidify your post. The closing section is an epilogue with a punchline, or as Wolken tells it, a CTA, a Call To Action line. A short punchy and powerful sentence to entangle your readers. Down the line is all about having a flow in your writing and sticking to the point. Finally, there are some tips on how to clean and perfect your post, and also the tools for proofreading.

All in all is very engaging while viewing it, I had ideas hitting me all over the place. Also, a template and structured writing came out of it. Very recommended and many thanks to Wolken Navarro for making this course.
