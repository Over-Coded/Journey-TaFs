13) - [Readme Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/)

This is the first side lesson, it is about the readmes. Apparently, and not without reason, readmes have standards. Makes sense but I did not know about it. Easy lesson, probably about half an hour or so, clear and builds up real fast. First about the readmes, about layout and how to represent it. Then moved to knowledge-wikis, how to build and construct them properly (markdown) and some more extra info related to the next review. All in all it is not exactly a lesson, more like some guidelines, guidelines on the bare minimums of readmes. I view it more like the standards of the internet, or as Joel might have said it "The absolute bare minimums every developer should now about Readmes". Good conduct, read it, learn what a readme me is what does it why it is there in the first place. You know, I have some years on me, some years of home computer repairs you know going around and repairing folks personal computers. The reason i am telling you this, is cause i am the person that looks readmes and deletes them or forgets about them. That has changed it is my firm believe after this read, that readmes are a very important part of any project. Please add it to the requirements. Licenses as well, more on that on another article.

These are 7 sources used to learn the basics of markdown, and some more special like creating lists with multiple checkboxes in a horizontal line. I know how to do them vertically, but horizontal was a problem.
Lets analyze them properly, one by one mind you, the order might not be perfect. Until the curriculum is updated and I can make some sense of it. IF you are following me in this, until my system is perfected, please send me your contact details and we can discuss it. Now let us begin.

        Alrighty first one is the basics of markdown. If you notice some similarities with HTML, there are, in fact HTML and Markdown are of the same genre of languages, Markup. The way i understood it is, that you mark specific words or text, with special tags. And the text takes the properties of the tag. Wether that is to hide the link into a desguise text, add an image, make lists, quoting text. Diffrent from HTML not in the handling of the text but more actually in the cimmands used to mark your text. Example: 
```
HTML bold tag <b>text</b>
Markdown bold tag **text**
  ```
        Diffrent commands, diffrent types or dialects of a language, same results. And from here we can go to the links in the bottom of the website. Four of them and the first from the top is our pick.
