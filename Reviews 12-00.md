## Reviews from 13 to 00.


13) - [Readme Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/)

This is the first side lesson, it is about the readmes. Apparently, and not without reason, readmes have standards. Makes sense but I did not know about it. Easy lesson, probably about half an hour or so, clear and builds up real fast. First about the readmes, then about layout and after that how to represent it. Then moved to knowledge-wikis, how to build and construct them properly (markdown) and some more extra info related to the next review. All in all it is not exactly a lesson, more like some guidelines, guidelines on the bare minimums of readmes. I consider it more like standards of the internet, or as Joel might have said it "The absolute bare minimums every developer should now about Readmes". Good conduct, read it, learn what a readme me is, the reason for existence, etc. You know, I have some years on me, some years of home computer repairs going around folks places and repairing or making changes to personal computers. The reason I am telling you this, is cause due to this when a readme is on my way it gets tossed instantly. That did change after that. It is now my firm believe, that readmes are a very important part of any project. Please add it to the requirements. Licenses as well, more on that on another article. Next is Markdown.

These are 7 sources used to learn the basics of markdown, and some more special like creating lists with multiple checkboxes in a horizontal line. I know how to do them vertically, but the horizontal was a problem. Lets analyze them properly, one by one mind you, the order might not be perfect. Until the curriculum is updated and I can make some sense of it. IF you are following me in this, until my system is perfected, please bear with me, this is trial and error. Also please contact me via any means of social, I would love to have a discussion and some fresh ideas, approaches etc. Now let us begin.

14) - [Markdown - Basics #1](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Alrighty first one we are gonna cover is the basics of markdown. If you notice some similarities with HTML, it is cause they are in fact almost the same, HTML and Markdown are part of same genre of languages, Markup. The way I understood it is, that you mark specific words or text, with special tags. And the text takes the properties of the tag. Wether that is to hide the link into a desguise text, add an image, make lists, or quoting text. Different from HTML not in how it is handling the text but more actually in the commands used to mark your text. Here an example: 

```

HTML bold tag <b>text</b>
Markdown bold tag **text**

```

Different commands, Different types or dialects of a language, same results. Now let me explain it properly, is it a method of text formatting for having structured documents. Website = Text Document with structure and a formation, a way of presenting organized information. Time to move on, four links in the bottom of the site and the first from the top is our pick.
    
15) - [Markdown - Advanced #3](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
    
This is the first link and it is just my luck to be a wee bit advanced. How so? Because here we are into GFM, Git Flavored Markdown, a dialect of markdown. Meaning it has a base of Markdown, hence and the name of course, and some customized commands used to make communicating with GitHub. And so this is a lesson taken later after some more markdown done. That been said let us proceed to the the actual lesson. We will be switching the terminology for starters cause it's wrong. Commands are as I call them is the syntax and the semantics of the language. Semantics are for a rather extensive review, cause it is a category on its own, having semantics for everything, it seemed to me that it is very important, in so it will be covered on it's onw separate category of skills. Now back to the lesson at hand. Personally I went through it and it was very difficult to understand it. So forth make a note of it. We will use it again in future reference, as of now it is not needed atm. Learning actual HTML is more important. We need some basics, in order to get started. After that it is all a matter of getting into the Git more seriously. We can use git to learn languages as well, so it is a win win, like typing is constantly improved.


16) - [Markdown - Basics #1](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)

This link is really small, based and focused more in the graphical interface of the website. Yeap we are talking about the website, doesn't need any syntax. It is the most simple way to format your text. Press a button and the magic happens. Simple and effective. It shows and explains to you, what every button in the ribbon does. In case we bored, well not much else going on here let us move on to the next one.

17) - [Markdown - Basics #2](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting)

This is about advanced formatting and syntax, it is split into three different sections with three sub links. First about how to organize your information with tables, then about the creation and highlighting of code blocks and lastly about auto linking and URLs. Let us begin with the tables, cause this is a really small page as well.

17A) - [Markdown - Basics #2A](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/organizing-information-with-tables)

Tables, what are tables inside a text document; Tables are like drawing a sketch, with pencil and paper. And instead of using vertical and horizontal lines we use hyphens and pipes. |-, Yes it is as simple as that, just write your info and use hyphens | to separate them horizontally, and pipes - under them for vertical separation. And there your have it, the syntax picks it up, a table, magic happens.
            
 17B) - [Markdown - Basics #2B](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)

There we go again a bit in depth. I can recognize ruby and Js, so all in all the gist of it is: That a triple backtick before and after, will create a box which can house code. Writing code that needs to be displayed, instead of processed. For example writing the bold syntax tag instead of making the text bold. Not so techie now e?

17C) - [Markdown - Basics #2C](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls)

Like before, a bit techie but not so much. This one lets you know that there are automatic methods of link shortening, and auto link reference. What does that mean exactly, means that you can write for example: #26 and it is the same as https://github/jlord/sheetsee.js/issues/26, yeah, well it is life saving. Truth is I can't quite make out all of it, but as we said before the important bits. We need just as much info as possible but not the heavy things.

18) - [Markdown - Basics #3](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

This is your bread and butter right there, bookmark this and save it under a cheat sheet folder or something. This is a list that contains the most basic syntax. It is light to read as well, read it a couple of times and practice the syntax, as you type markdown you will be using this list quite often, until not. This is the same with mostly everything we will learn so cheat sheets are the way to go for the long run.

20) - [Markdown - Advanced #2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31694871/markdown-multi-checkbox-in-one-line)

Again this is for reference as well, I was in the need of checklists, and this was my answer. As for the second link, I've decided to include it as an extra. How to create a vertical multi check box inside a line. And that was it, this covers in extend the basic markdown we need, some advanced bits and some extras. Also a reference card, well to be honest these are small reads, not really an review each, so consider this to be a big review broken down in sections. Next up is Licenses, how, what, whys, and what to avoid. Have a nice night.
