    <!--The head element is a very busy place for most websites, so we've created
    a tutorial to walk you through the different elements and tasks accomplished
    in the head element. You can find it at the following address:

  <body>
    <!--The body element contains the full visible content of the web page-->

          <!--Sections are used to seperate major parts of an element, such as

          <!--Within a sidebar you could use section elements to identify the 
          different parts of the sidebar. For example, you could put adds in

          signup form in a third section element.-->
