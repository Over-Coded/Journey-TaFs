How To Write a Better Blog Post.

Viral blog writing 101 by Wolken Navarro.

Blogging, Blog post Writing, viral.

Welcome! According to today's schedule, it is a blog day. And this course was the best option for a beginner's class. So without further ado, let us proceed to the overview.

It begins with a very basic and short part about how your blog should be structured precisely. Moving on from general blog strategy to post writing strategy. Covering everything from the headline picking to grammar checking tools. There is even a part that covers the angles on post writing. Simple, detailed and not very long as well, about 73 minutes.

And as I mentioned before this lesson is around 1 hour and 13 minutes. Not very long considering the output of info it has. Very detailed and he also has a very clear voice which makes the lesson so much better. On to the actual thing now. After the introduction video, there are some basic blog structure rules. The category of your blog, subcategory's and topics. Closing in with a few tips on how to pick an angle, for writing your post. Followed by a template, and to be honest that was a very good idea, and explanation's for each part. First up is the headline name picking and some suggestions, cause the actual headline strategies are explained more detailed in the ending videos. The new pickup was: SEO - Search Engine Optimization, which is used by search engines to find keywords and makes your post more easily discoverable. Again, more about that in later courses. Onwards to the introduction of the post, an anecdote or a short story. Or a Nutgraph, meaning a Post in a nutshell paragraph. To a transition line that makes getting into the main body of the post more smooth. This is followed by a few supporting key points to solidify your post. The closing section is an epilogue with a punchline, or as Wolken tells it, a CTA, a Call To Action line. A short punchy and powerful sentence to entangle your readers. Down the line is all about having a flow in your writing and sticking to the point. Finally, there are some tips on how to clean and perfect your post, and also the tools for proofreading.

All in all is very engaging while viewing it, I had ideas hitting me all over the place. Also, a template and structured writing came out of it. Very recommended and many thanks to Wolken Navarro for making this course.

Copyright, License, Copyright Protection, Distribution.

Welcome back to this long awaited review. I was under some heavy load and not able to get my head around it. More time to study I guess, anyway, licenses. Personal failure here, big one, we are talking about me waiting before publishing a single word for two weeks. Waiting for the license to be approved. Also we will talk about the real Registration of Licenses, as I learned it later by digging around.

It is simple, as I was writing about the first lessons and creating the blog, suddenly Copyright struck me. So the search on how to license my work, preferably for free, and be covered from plagiarism and theft began. I must have searched like, what, 4 hours? Eventually I stumbled upon the website number three on our list. Promising free registration and copyright protection, I began editing and submitting my work for evaluation and approval. After two weeks, I repeat- Two weeks- of thumb wars, frustrated and disappointed, I saw that the last approval went down in 2016.....Due to "Recent" changes, and yeah, some serious research, the truth was out. I was looking at the first website on our list, oh my, finally. Most shocking was that, all I had to do was, create a file named "License" on GitHub and you pick a dam license. Two weeks, how does that sound right about now? Before things get un-licensed here, let us talk about the different types of, ahem, free and instant licenses. Depending on what type of sharing you would like your project to have, how the crediting (if any) will be done and if you want to allow sharing as closed source. These are some of the factors that you should consider before picking a license. Lastly and most importantly, what happens if you don't have or don't want to license your work?Well, for starters, you are a possible victim of plagiarism, meaning someone can steal your work and take credit for it. Also most people will not touch any unlicensed work. All in all, lack of license doesn't do any good, if anything.

Remember, two weeks -sob- versus free instant license and copyright.
