Welcome my name is Alexander and I am from Greece. This sounds like the English lessons we had in school, well it does the job, let us continue. I am a computer technician or repairman, as you might say it in the common slang. I specialize in computer hardware, home and small shops, repairs and common tasks. Right now I am on a "journey" as you might say it hence and the name of the project, to become a self taught, freelance, full-stack developer. Some of my terminology is a bit off, so please correct me if I got something wrong. The projects concept is to log this Journey in a Online Git log, repository, maintaining a structure of a Website sitemap of sorts, containing skills and everything acquired and whole process. Succefully creating an Portfolio and a C/V. Another idea was to write reviews, about all the learning material used, effectively using the write to learn technique, both for understanding and in an effort to develop my writing skills. The reviews will feed the blog, in an effort to acquire some money through adds, views or by freelancing as a amateur writer, to upgrade my equipment. Ultimately I am hopping to provide income while providing for my family.
