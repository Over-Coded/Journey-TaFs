There have been some changes and so the creation of a new file is a must.

December 20                                 
<intro>
    Slow days, and also in the process of dealing with personal issues. Can't fight it so I am using
the time reading about soft skills, concepts and improving the already existing facts.
Also taking time to grow accustomed to the sites and all online tools and resources I will be using.
StackOverflow, GitHub, git, various learning sites, online reference lists, and local environment tools.
Getting to be a web developer from scratch, is on its own daunting. And is my firm belief, that despite
the tremendous amount of resources, online lessons and most importantly, the fast learning platforms that
exist out, that this learning curve one must take it slow, structured and in steps, to be good,
and have a chance of surviving an ever-evolving technology.

    <intro>
    There we go after all these days we are finally here, in so let us begin. First and foremost the 
    personal section, after all, affects everything we do or want to do. Changing houses will be done 
    after the holidays due to a change in work hours. Changing from Friday/Saturday to Saturday/Tuesday/
    Wednesday, and that in the night shift is very bad. None the less with the little time we had left
    we squeezed some details of, most of the changes after the holidays.
