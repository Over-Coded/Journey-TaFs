December 20                                 
<intro>
    Slow days, and also in the proccess of dealing with personal issues. Cant fight it so i am using
the time reading about soft skills, concepts and improving the already excisting facts.
Also taking time to grow accostumed to the sites and all online tools and resources i will be using.
stackoverflow, github, git, various learn sites, online reference lists and local enviroment tools.
Getting to be a web developer from scratch, is on its own daunting. And is my firm belief, that despite
the tremendous amount of resources, online lessons and most importantly, the fast learning platforms that
excist out, that this learning curve one must take it slow, structurized and in steps, in order to be good,
and have a chance of surviving an ever evolving technology.
